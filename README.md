. Project Setup:
- First of all, I created a new React Native app by creating a new project with Expo or with the minimal set up for a React Native project.
- I set up all dependencies for the application starting with the React Navigation and any other dependencies that may be needed for the application.

2. Bottom Tabs Navigation:
- I managed to implement the bottom tabs navigation through the help of the `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` package.
- I also prepared the Home and Settings screens and any other screens that may be presently in the application.
- I anticipated that I needed to check the transitions between the screens are okay.

3. Light and Dark Theme:
- This is an example of something new which I added, the ability to easily toggle between a light and a dark theme.
- This could be done with help of React Context or some state management library like Redux or MobX.
- I created the light.theme and dark.theme basic objects in which the colors and other styles of the two themes were defined.
- These theme objects I have used throughout the application to adorn the UI elements of the application.

4. UI Design and Styling:
- I carefully analyzed the given UI mock up and tried my best to make the design of the application resemble it.
- As for the UI all the views and items were created using React Native built-in components view, Text, TouchableOpacity etc and newly created components.
- I developed libraries for the most frequently used UI parts like a button, card, form inputs, and many more.
- For the implementation of the UI design I used the styling system provided by React Native, which is known as StyleSheet API below is a brief of style I used for different components:-

5. Code Organization and Best Practices:Code Organization and Best Practices:
- I structured the code following coherent patterns, including screen categories, components, styles and, utilities.
- All the recommendations considering development of React Native were taken into consideration.
- Therefore, to enhance my program, I added proper error control, accessibility features and any other fromality to ensure the creation of a powerful application.
